# EXERCISE 1.16

## Description

I used Render.com to deploy my dockerized personal trainer application. Here's what i did:

1. Signed in to Render.com and selected "New" -> "Web Service".
2. Connected the GitHub-repository containing my personal trainer app.
3. Render automatically configured the service settings correctly.
4. Pressed "Create Web Service" and Render handled the rest, pulling the repository, building the image and deploying the app.
